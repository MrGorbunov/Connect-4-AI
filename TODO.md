# TODO


---

[ ] Min Max Algorithim

[ ] Rework board class to track connections
   This will save a lot of compute time because
   new instances will not need to recheck entire board.
   Also gives info needed to draw the winning streak.
[ ] Static evalutations
   It would be really cool to have different evaluations
   and put them against each other.   
[ ] Alpha / Beta Pruning
[ ] Integrate to work with GUI
[ ] Order optimization
   Figure out how to prioritize more interesting moves -
   probably will also be some sort of running total, getting
   updated with each move

[ ] UI / UX

[ ] Add way to restart
[ ] Connect to Pi to take button inputs
[ ] Display wins & winner
[ ] Falling sound effect
