# TODO


---

- [ ] Min Max Algorithim

- [X] Rework board class to track connections
   This will save a lot of compute time because
   new instances will not need to recheck entire board.
   Also gives info needed to draw the winning connection
   Puts blocked off chains into dead\_chains list
- [X] Static evalutations
   It would be really cool to have different evaluations
   and put them against each other.   
- [X] Minmax Implementation
- [X] Alpha / Beta Pruning
- [X] Integrate to work with GUI
- [ ] Order optimization
   Figure out how to prioritize more interesting moves -
   probably will also be some sort of running total, getting
   updated with each move

- [ ] UI / UX

- [ ] Add way to restart
- [ ] Connect to Pi to take button inputs
- [X] Display wins & winner
- [ ] Falling sound effect
