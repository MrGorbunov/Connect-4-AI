# Connect-4-AI
An AI that can play a game of connect 4 with you.

This project is in python 2 (written in 2.7.17), _will not work with python3_
The GUI is written with pygame
Images made with Gimp (only the .pngs are in this repo)
Sounds downloaded from freesounds.com

The AI functions via a min-max algorithm. The only inputs for the player are left, right, and select.

There were initially plans to make this run on a Pi, but that was dropped.


## Legal

All sound effects are downloaded, but are CC-0 and so do not require attribution

All images were created by me in GIMP (which has GNU in the name so you know it's good)
