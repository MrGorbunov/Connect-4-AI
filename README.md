# Connect-4-AI
An AI that can run on a Raspberry Pi and take button inputs to play a game of connect 4 with you.

This project is in python
The GUI is written with pygame
Images made with Gimp (only the .pngs are in this repo)

The AI functions via a min-max algorithm. The only inputs for the player are left, right, and select.

This is currently in development, so there are still a lot of missing things (AI, Pi integration, etc)
